'''
Given a binary tree where all the right nodes are either leaf nodes with a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent node) or empty, flip it upside down and turn it into a tree where the original right nodes turned into left leaf nodes. Return the new root.

Example:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]

    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5

Output: return the root of the binary tree [4,5,2,#,#,3,1]

   4
  / \
 5   2
    / \
   3   1  
Clarification:

Confused what [4,5,2,#,#,3,1] means? Read more below on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.

The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

Here's an example:

   1
  / \
 2   3
    /
   4
    \
     5
The above binary tree is serialized as [1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5].

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):

class Solution:
    def upsideDownBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        if not root or not root.left:
            return root
        
        node = self.upsideDownBinaryTree(root.left)
        root.left.left = root.right
        root.left.right = root
        root.left = None
        root.right = None
        
        return node
